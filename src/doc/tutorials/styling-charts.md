# Styling Britecharts
In the [Getting Started Guide][gettingStartedGuide] and the [Composing Your First Data Visualization tutorial][composingDatavizGuide] we saw how to create and configure Britecharts. We have created beatiful charts, however, users have specific branding and styling needs that want to get in their charts to adapt to their user interfaces.

In this tutorial, we will go over the different options we have to customize Britecharts. You will learn how you can use Britechart's color schemas to change the charts colors or customize your own. We will also see how to override the CSS styles that come with Britecharts and how to update the fonts.

## Applying a color palette
Let's look at some customization options we have available for Britecharts. The first one is the color schemas and gradients. You can find some of them in our [Color Palettes demo page][colorPalettesDemo].
